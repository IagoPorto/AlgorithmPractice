/**
Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
    s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
    s represents a valid expression.
    '+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
    '-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
    There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
    Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

    private int calc(String s) {
        int res = 0, num = 0, sign = 1;
        while (idx < s.length()) {
            char c = s.charAt(idx++);
            if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') num = num * 10 + c - '0';
            else if (c == '(') num = calc(s); // ( is start of a new sub-problem, Let recursion solve the sub-problem
            else if (c == ')') return res + sign * num;
            else if (c == '+' || c == '-') { // only when we meet a new sign, we know a while number has been read
                res += sign * num;
                num = 0;
                sign = c == '-' ? -1 : 1;
            }
        }
        return res + sign * num; // last number is not processed yet
    }
